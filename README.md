Airbnb Inc is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. Airbnb has close to 150 million customers across the world. Price is the most important factor considered by the customer while making booking into a property. Strategic pricing of the properties is important to avoid losing customers to the competitors.

We have a data of 74111 Airbnb properties across the nations. Based on this data I have built a simple and multiple linear regression model to predict the strategic pricing of a new listed property on Airbnb.
